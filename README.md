## Introduction

Broadcast proxy reencryption (BPRE), which combines broadcast encryption (BE) and proxy reencryption (PRE), is a technology
used for the redistribution of data uploaded on the cloud to multiple users. BPRE reencrypts data encrypted by the distributor and
then uploads it to the cloud into a ciphertext that at a later stage targets multiple recipients. As a result of this, flexible data sharing
is possible for multiple recipients.

We have implemented the research paper in python using concepts of Object Oriented Programming which is 
used to simulate the intraction between KGC, sender, proxy(cloud) and multiple recievers.
